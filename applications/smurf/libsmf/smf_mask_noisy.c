*  Name:
*     smf_mask_noisy

*  Purpose:
*     Calculate the noise of each bolometer and remove the noisiest

*  Language:
*     Starlink ANSI C

*  Type of Module:
*     Library routine

*  Invocation:
*     smf_mask_noisy( ThrWorkForce *wf, smfData *data, smfData **noise,
*                     double sigcliphigh, double sigcliplow, int cliplog,
*                     int zeropad, int * status );

*  Arguments:
*     wf = ThrWorkForce * (Given)
*        Pointer to a pool of worker threads. Can be NULL.
*     data = smfData * (Given and Returned)
*        The data that will be flagged
*     noise = smfData ** (Returned)
*        Optionally return pointer to smfData containing noise map. Can be NULL.
*     sigcliphigh = double (Given)
*        Number of standard deviations above median to clip noisy bolometers.
*        Ignored unless value is greater than zero.
*     sigcliplow = double (Given)
*        Number of standard deviations below median to clip noisy bolometers.
*        Ignored unless value is greater than zero.
*     cliplog = int (Given)
*        If set, calculate statistics on log of noise instead of noise
*     zeropad = int (Given)
*        Pad with zeros instead of with artificial data prior to doing
*        the FFTs?
*     status = int* (Given and Returned)
*        Pointer to global status.

*  Description:
*     Calculates the noise for each bolometer for a specific frequency
*     range using smf_bolonoise. Then for any bolometers that are out
*     of specification it sets their quality to bad using
*     SMF__Q_NOISE.  The log of the noise values can be used instead
*     of the values themselves if the distribution has large
*     tails. The clipping itself is done with smf_clipnoise.

*  Notes:

*  History:
*     2010-07-02 (TIMJ):
*        Initial version
*     2010-07-07 (TIMJ):
*        Use new quality scheme.
*     2010-09-16 (EC):
*        Optionally return noisemap
*     2010-09-28 (DSB):
*        Added zeropad argument.
*     2010-10-08 (DSB):
*        Fill gaps before calling smf_bolonoise.
*     2011-04-14 (DSB):
*        Remove gap filling since it is done in smf_fft_data (called by
*        bolonoise).
*     2011-04-20 (TIMJ):
*        Use rt(s) instead of /rt(Hz) for noise units.
*     2011-06-23 (EC):
*        - Move clipping into smf_clean_smfArray call, enabling us to use
*          log instead of actual values if desired.
*        - sigcliphigh and sigcliplow instead of sigclip
*        - median instead of mean for central measure
