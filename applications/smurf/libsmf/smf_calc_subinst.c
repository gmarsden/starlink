 *  Name:
 *     smf_calc_subinst

 *  Purpose:
 *     Determines the sub-instrument identifier

 *  Language:
 *     Starlink ANSI C

 *  Type of Module:
 *     Library routine

 *  Invocation:
 *     subinst = smf_calc_subinst( const smfHead *hdr, int *status );

 *  Arguments:
 *     hdr = const smfHead * (Given)
 *        Header struct.
 *     status = int* (Given and Returned)
 *        Pointer to global status.

 *  Description:
 *     Determine the "sub-instrument" based on header information. For
 *     SCUBA-2 this really means simply whether it is a 850 or 450 micron
 *     data file. This is more reliable than using an equality check with
 *     the wavelength because the wavelength can change as filters are
 *     updated.

 *  Returned Value:
 *     smf_calc_subinst = smf_subinst_t
 *        Sub instrument enum constant. Returns SMF__SUBINST_NONE if the
 *        sub instrument can not be determined for whatever reason.

 *  Authors:
 *     Tim Jenness (JAC, Hawaii)
 *     AGM: Gaelen Marsden (UBC)

 *  History:
 *     2010-01-08 (TIMJ):
 *        Initial Version
 *     2014-08-29 (AGM):
 *        Hack to handle SWCAM

 *  Notes:
 *     Only useful for SCUBA-2 at present.
